This project aims to research the  Pewlett Hackard corporation employees from the 1980s and the 1990s. There are 6 CSV files of employees information remaining from that time.

In this assignment, I design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, it would be called data engineering and data analysis.
